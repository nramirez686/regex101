# Regex 101

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use regular expressions (regex) to match email addresses in JavaScript. Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching, and understanding them is crucial for web developers.

## Tutorial Summary

In this tutorial, we will delve into a specific regular expression used for matching email addresses:
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
This regular expression ensures that user input is a valid email address. We will break down each component of this regex and explain its purpose.
